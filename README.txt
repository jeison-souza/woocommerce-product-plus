== Translations ==
===========
* English - default, always included
* Portuguse, Brazilian (pt_BR): PortuguÃªs - default by me, always included

* For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/woocommerce-product-plus/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `woocommerce-product-plus-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that.

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.
